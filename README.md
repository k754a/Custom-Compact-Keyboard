**Hi! This is my custom compact keyboard code!**

**How to Install:**

1. Connect the Pico to your computer, holding down the BOOT button as you connect.
2. When a folder opens with the Pico directory, download and drag and drop this file: [CircuitPython for Raspberry Pi Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/).
3. After it reconnects, drag and drop the `lib` and `code.py` files into the Pico directory.

You're done! ðŸ˜Š
